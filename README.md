## 📌 Inspiration

Educators often struggle with the repetitive and time-consuming process of grading countless student submissions. Our vision was to harness AI's potential to build a tool that **automates the grading process without compromising on fairness, clarity, or accuracy**. That vision became **grAIder** — your AI teaching assistant for code evaluation.

## 🚀 What It Does

grAIder is an AI-powered platform designed to evaluate student code submissions across multiple languages. It:

- 🧠 **Analyzes** code for accuracy, logic, efficiency, and style  
- 📝 **Provides** dynamic feedback with inline annotations and suggestions  
- 🚨 **Flags** bugs, errors, and edge cases  
- 📊 **Grades** automatically based on customizable rubrics  
- 🌐 **Supports** multiple programming languages  
- 📎 **Stores** evaluation data for easy access and reference

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Backend:** Python & Flask — handles API requests, logic, and routing  
- **AI Engine:** Integrated **Gemini APIs** to evaluate code quality and offer contextual insights  
- **Database:** SQLite — stores submissions, rubrics, and results  
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS — modern, responsive, and intuitive UI for educators
